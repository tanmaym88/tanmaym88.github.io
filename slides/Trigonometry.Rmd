# Introduction to Trigonometry

- A branch of Mathematics that studies the relationships between the ratios of side lengths and angles of a triangle. It also involves solving problems related to the ratios. 
- It gets it names from the Greek words: "treîs" (three) + "gōnía" (angles) + "metron" (measure).
- It has its pplications in: Civil Engineering, Astronomy, Navigation, Acoustics, Optics, Architecture, etc.
- Has been studied by mankind for thousands of years.

## Slide header 1

- A first item with some equation $x^y$
-   A second item with some other equation $$(a+b)^2=a^2+bc^2$$
