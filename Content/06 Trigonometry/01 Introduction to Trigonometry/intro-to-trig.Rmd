# Introduction
<hr class="style2">

- Trigonometry is a branch of Mathematics that studies the relationships between the ratios of side lengths and angles of a triangle. It also involves solving problems related to the ratios. 
- It gets its name from the Greek words: "treîs" (three) + "gōnía" (angles) + "metron" (measure).
- It has its applications in: Civil Engineering, Astronomy, Navigation, Acoustics, Optics, Architecture, etc.
- Has been studied by mankind for thousands of years.

# Angles and its Measurements
<hr class="style2">

<div class="fragment">
**Angle:** Let a ray $\vec{OA}$, when rotated about its end point $O$, results in the position $OB$. Then we say that the angle $\angle AOB$ has been generated.<br>

</div>
<div class="fragment">
The initial position $OA$ is called the *initial side* and the final position $OB$ is called the *terminal side* of the angle. The end point $O$ is called the *vertex* of the angle.
</div>

<div class="fragment">
**Measure of an Angle: ** The amount of rotation performed or the amount of *circular distance* travelled by the ray is called the measure of an angle.<br>
</div>

<div class="fragment">
**Sign Convention:** The sign of the angle is considered to be positive or negativeistalyporquesmakiportari, according as the ray is rotated in the anticlockwise or the clockwise direction.<br>

We will use a theorem
